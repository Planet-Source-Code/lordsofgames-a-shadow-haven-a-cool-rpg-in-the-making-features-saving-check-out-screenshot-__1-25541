A cool RPG in the making!-Final Fantasy style! Features include: Saving, battle mode, map maker, cool menu, new games, saving positions, and a hell lot more! Check it out! Some of you might have seen my Final Fantasy battle engine that I've submitted a few weeks ago, well I'll be adding that in here! Small download!

Just like Final Fantasy!
